## Welcome to the Game of Trouble!
## The rules of the game are as follows: 
- There will be 4 players (the user will be one and the rest will be CPU players). 
- The goal of the game is to be the first player to move all four of your pieces from home to finish. 
- You must roll a 6 in order to move a piece out of home.
- For each turn you get to roll the dice once, unless you get a 6. 
- If you get a 6 you get to keep rolling and moving your pieces until you roll a different number (not 6).  
- You can’t land on your own pieces. 
- If you land on an opponent’s piece, they will be sent back to home and you get to stay in that spot. 
- Once a piece is close to the finish, you must roll the exact number to move your piece into an open finish spot.
- If you are the first person to move all your pieces from home to finish, you win!

### How to play:
- To start the game, select which team you would like to be on by pressing either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Press the dice in 
the center of the board 
- If you are team one and roll a six, you will select a piece to move by pressing either 1, 2, 3, or 4
- If you roll a six, you can repeat the above process until your turn is over 
- Otherwise, the turn moves to the next player (CPU)
- If it is not your team's turn, press the die to roll for the CPU and then press 5 
- This will allow the CPU to play their move
- Continue to do this for every other CPU team until you reach your turn
- Once a piece is close to the finish, you must roll the exact number to move your piece into an open finish spot
- If you are the first person to move all your pieces from home to finish, you win!
