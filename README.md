## Welcome to the Game of Trouble!
### The rules of the game are as follows: There will be 4 players (the user will be one and the rest will be CPU players). The goal of the game is to be the first player to move all four of your pieces from home to finish. Each player gets four pieces. For each turn you get to roll the dice once, unless you get a 6. If you get a 6 you get to keep rolling until it is any other number. You must roll a 6 in order to start that piece on the board. You can’t land on your own pieces including on start. If you land on an opponent’s piece, they will be sent back to home and you get to stay in that spot. Once you get to the last spot before the finish row you must roll the exact number to move your piece into an empty finish spot. When you have filled all the finish spots with your pieces, you have won!

- To start the game, select which team you would like to be on by pressing either 1, 2, 3, or 4. If you are team 1, press the dice in 
the center of the board and if you get a 6, you will be able to select a piece. Whenever you roll a 6, you will get to keep 
rolling and moving your pieces until you don't have a 6 anymore. For example, if you roll a 6 and move that amount of spaces
and then roll again, and you get a 4, you will get to move 4 spaces, but that ends your turn after that.
Once you roll a 6 and have at least one piece on the board, you will be able to select whichever 
piece you want to move at the beginning of our turn by pressing 1, 2, 3, or 4. Once your turn is over, it is the CPU's turn. 
Press the dice for the CPU and then press 5 on your keyboard. The CPU will determine which piece to move during its turn. Once it is done,
press the dice again and then 5. Repeat this one more time and then it will be back to your turn where you can roll and choose which piece you want to move.
Once a piece is close to the finish spots, you must roll the exact number to land on finish spots and move your piece there. For example, if you are 3 
spaces away from the first finish spot and you roll a 3, you get to move there. 
If you are the first person to fill all your finish spots, you win!
